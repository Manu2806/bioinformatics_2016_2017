# bioinformatics 2016-2017

Bioinformatics course at University of Groningen 2016-2016.

## Schedule

[of last year]

[should now start at 9:30]

 * 9:30-9:??: Lecture by Kees and Jorik
 * 9:15-9:20: Read grading
 * 9:25-9:35: git workflow demo
 * 9:35-9:45: Experiment: create GitHub, try workflow
 * 9:45-10:00: Break
 * 10:00-10:15: Experiment
 * 10:15-10:25: Lecture by Richel: workflow again
 * 10:25-10:45: Experiment
 * 10:45-11:00: Break
 * 11:00-11:15: Lecture by Richel: collaboration
 * 11:15-11:55: Experiment
 * 11:55-12:00: Closing lecture by Richel

Lectures start *sharply* at the time indicated. The most important lecture will be from 9:40-9:45. Breaks are mandatory (getting away from that computer improves learning), but only for something quick, e.g. getting a coffee.

## Grading exercise git and GitHub 

You will be graded on three things:

 * The GitHub you create for your project
 * Your GitHub profile
 * A document titled 'The Grade I Deserve Is ...'

Deadline for these is at Thursday the 20th of January 18:00 (note: with your GitHub work, I will take a look at the repository at the last time before 18:01).

The GitHub you create for your project should demonstrate that you've explored the possibilities of GitHub.
Possibilities to explore are, for example:

 * Create a nice `README.md` with useful pictures
 * Put your TODO list at the Issues
 * Add a license
 * Add a `.gitignore` file
 * Issues that are closed
 * Make a commit with the right username and email address
 * Multiple commits with meaningful commit messages
 * A merge conflict that has been checked in, then fixed in a later commit, e.g. [Fairytale_test](https://github.com/Lumphie/Fairytale_test)
 * A complete deletion of the GitHub its content, that has been undone in the next commit
 * A Pull Request from someone else, that has been accepted
 * A Pull Request from someone else, that has been rejected
 * Create more branches

Also the GitHub profile should demonstrate that you've explored the possibilties of GitHub.
Possibilities are, for example:

 * A profile picture
 * Becoming a collaborator at another GitHub and add content
 * Issue posted at GitHubs you are not a collaborator of
 * A GitHub you have forked
 * A successfull Pull Request you have made to another GitHub
 * A Pull Request you've made to another GitHub, that has been rejected
 * Following people
 * Starring GitHub projects

The document titled 'The Grade I Deserve Is ...' should be a Markdown file on your GitHub. Your README.md should mention it, so it can be found easily.

The document should convince the reader which grade you deserve on today's exercise. Aim for a 6 when you just did the bare minimum, aim for an 8 when you did your best. The document should have few words and many screenshots. It *should* not be a professional document: you will waste your time when you make that document pretty.

Things that have low/none impact for your grade:

 * Biological relevance
 * Spelling errors
 * Slick looks
 
For those going for a high grade:

 * Fix more complex Issues, especially of your classmates
 * Improve the code of your classmates
 * Experiment with Git and GitHub features that I have not described
 * Use Travis CI to check something
 * Display a Travis CI badge

For foreigners, this is (my interpretation of) the Dutch number scale:

* 10: Perfect (nearly impossible to achieve)
* 9: Excellent (rare)
* 8: Good
* 7: Okay
* 6: Mediocre
* 5: Sloppy
* 4: Bad (rare)
* 3: Terrible (very rare)
* 2: Utter crap (extremely rare)
* 1: Did not do anything
